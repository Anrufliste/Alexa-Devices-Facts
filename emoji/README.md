# EMOJIs on ALEXA devices
While using APL with a text Element on an Echo Show, I recognized that not all emoji have been supported. So in late 2019 I made an analysis of every available emoji and discovered that back then 410 emoji have not been supported. I published this result within a picture of all unsupported emoji:
* in an [article about APL](hhttps://github.com/Anrufliste/Web-Mobile-Developer/blob/main/wmd_0220_S058_069.pdf) in the Web & Mobile Developer Magazin 02/20
* in a [twitter post](https://twitter.com/anrufliste/status/1217137755643400198?s=21)

Here I try to keep up to date with the improvement of the APL emoji support as well as new emoji. For the later there are specialized sources like <https://emojipedia.org>

While my wife is using a lot of Emojis in text message, I recognized that Siri is using similar text for different. So I was curious how Alexa handles Emojis if they are part of TTS output. So
besides the visual support I also included Audio support, how Alexa is "speaking" out the emoji in English and German.
