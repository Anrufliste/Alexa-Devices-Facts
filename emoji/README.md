# EMOJI on ALEXA devices with SCREENS
While using APL with a text Element on an Echo Show, I recognized that not all emoji have been supported. So in late 2019 I made an analysis of every available emoji and discovered that back then 410 emoji have not been supported. I published this result within a picture of all unsupported emoji:
* in an [article about APL](https://www.webundmobile.de/mobile/amazon/multimodale-skills-alexa-2422228.html) in the Web & Mobile Developer Magazin 02/20
* in a [twitter post](https://twitter.com/anrufliste/status/1217137755643400198?s=21)

Here I try to keep up to date with the improvement of the APL emoji support as well as new emoji. For the later there are specialized sources like <https://emojipedia.org>
